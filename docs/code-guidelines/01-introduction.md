These css guidelines have been created to do the following:    

* keep stylesheets maintainable
* keep code easy to read
* keep stylesheets scalable

## Why are these css guidelines important?

* to build and maintain products for a reasonable length of time
* to have developers of differing abilities and specialisms understand the codebase
* to have a number of different developers working on a product at any given time

A good coding styleguide that is adhered to will:

* set the standard of code expected across a codebase
* promote consistency across a codebase
* give a feeling of familiarity for developers
* increase productivity levels

Styleguides should be learned, understood, and implemented at all times on a project which is governed by one, and any deviation must be fully justified.

These guidelines have been crafted by a very talented developer by the name of Harry Roberts, to not use these guidelines would be an insult to the great work this guy does.
