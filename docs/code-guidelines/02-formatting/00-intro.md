By having a standard way of writing CSS means that the codebase will always remain familiar to all members of the team.

At the highest level, we want:

* 4 space indents, no tabs
* 80 character wide columns
* Multi-line CSS
* Good meaningful use of whitespace

Consistency is the key to a solid clean codebase.
