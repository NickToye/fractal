Where possible, please limit css files width to 80 characters. Most editors will have a feature to show this line as a guide. Reasons for this are:

* the ability to have multiple files side by side helps with development
* viewing CSS on GitLab or in the Terminal is more readable
* provides a comfortable line length for comments
