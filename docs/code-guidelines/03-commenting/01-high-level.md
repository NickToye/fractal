For large comments that document entire sections or components, we use a DocBlock-esque multi-line comment which adheres to our 80 column width.

/**
 * The siteâ€™s main page-head can have two different states:
 *
 * 1) Regular page-head with no backgrounds or extra treatments; it just
 *    contains the logo and nav.
 * 2) A masthead that has a fluid-height (becoming fixed after a certain point)
 *    which has a large background image, and some supporting text.
 *
 * The regular page-head is incredibly simple, but the masthead version has some
 * slightly intermingled dependency with the wrapper that lives inside it.
