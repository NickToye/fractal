title: Naming Conventions

Naming conventions in CSS are hugely useful in making your code more strict, more transparent, and more informative.

A good naming convention will tell you and your team

* what type of thing a class does
* where a class can be used
* what (else) a class might be related to

The naming convention I follow is very simple: hyphen (-) delimited strings, with BEM-like naming for more complex pieces of code.

Itâ€™s worth noting that a naming convention is not normally useful CSS-side of development; they really come into their own when viewed in HTML.
