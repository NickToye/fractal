Your selectors are fundamental to writing good CSS. To very briefly sum up the above sections:

* Select what you want explicitly, rather than relying on circumstance or coincidence. Good Selector Intent will rein in the reach and leak of your styles.
* Write selectors for reusability, so that you can work more efficiently and reduce waste and repetition.
* Do not nest selectors unnecessarily, because this will increase specificity and affect where else you can use your styles.
* Do not qualify selectors unnecessarily, as this will impact the number of different elements you can apply styles to.
* Keep selectors as short as possible, in order to keep specificity down and performance up.
