title: Architectural Principles

You would be forgiven for thinking that an architecture for CSS is a somewhat grandiose and unnecessary concept: why would something so simple, so straightforward, need something as complex or considered as an architecture?!

Well, as we’ve seen, CSS’ simplicity, its looseness, and its unruly nature mean that the best way of managing (read, taming) it at any reasonable scale is through a strict and specific architecture. A solid architecture can help us control our specificity, enforce naming conventions, manage our source order, create a sane development environment, and generally make managing our CSS projects a lot more consistent and comfortable.

There is no tool, no preprocessor, no magic bullet, that will make your CSS better on its own: a developer’s best tool when working with such a loose syntax is self-discipline, conscientiousness, and diligence, and a well-defined architecture will help enforce and facilitate these traits.

Architectures are large, overarching, principle-led collections of smaller conventions which come together to provide a managed environment in which code is written and maintained. Architectures are typically quite high level, and leave implementation details—such as naming conventions or syntax and formatting, for example—to the team implementing it.

Most architectures are usually based around existing design patterns and paradigms, and, more often than not, these paradigms were born of computer scientists and software engineers. For all CSS isn’t ‘code’, and doesn’t exhibit many traits that programming languages do, we find that we can apply some of these same principles to our own work.

In this section, we’ll take a look at some of these design patterns and paradigms, and how we can use them to reduce code—and increase code reuse—in our CSS projects.
